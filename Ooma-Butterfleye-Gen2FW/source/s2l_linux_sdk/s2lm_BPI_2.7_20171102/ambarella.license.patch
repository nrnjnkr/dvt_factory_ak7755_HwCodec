+		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+    		    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
+ numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+
+  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
+specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
+other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
+your libraries, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
+you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
+complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
+with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
+the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+
+  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
+version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
+the original authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
+software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
+transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
+we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
+free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
+GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
+license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
+designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
+one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
+the same as in the ordinary license.
+
+  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
+they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
+program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
+changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
+analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
+a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
+derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
+treats it as such.
+
+  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
+Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
+sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
+concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
+
+  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
+users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
+libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
+permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
+preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
+libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
+this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
+changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
+will lead to faster development of free libraries.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
+former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
+works together with the library.
+
+  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
+General Public License rather than by this special one.
+
+		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
+contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
+party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
+General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
+addressed as "you".
+
+  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+
+  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
+which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
+Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+included without limitation in the term "modification".)
+
+  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
+and installation of the library.
+
+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+and what the program that uses the Library does.
+  
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+Library.
+
+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
+
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
+
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
+
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
+
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
+
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
+
+    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
+
+    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
+
+    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
+distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
+
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
+
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
+
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
+
+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
+ordinary General Public License).
+
+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
+"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
+    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
+    Library General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
+    License along with this library; if not, write to the 
+    Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, 
+    Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
+  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

+7zMain.c     - Test application
+
+
+How To Use
+----------
+
+You can create .7z archive with 7z.exe, 7za.exe or 7zr.exe:
+
+  7z.exe a archive.7z *.htm -r -mx -m0fb=255
+
+If you have big number of files in archive, and you need fast extracting, 
+you can use partly-solid archives:
+  
+  7za.exe a archive.7z *.htm -ms=512K -r -mx -m0fb=255 -m0d=512K
+
+In that example 7-Zip will use 512KB solid blocks. So it needs to decompress only 
+512KB for extracting one file from such archive.
+
+
+Limitations of current version of 7z ANSI-C Decoder
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+ - It reads only "FileName", "Size", "LastWriteTime" and "CRC" information for each file in archive.
+ - It supports only LZMA and Copy (no compression) methods with BCJ or BCJ2 filters.
+ - It converts original UTF-16 Unicode file names to UTF-8 Unicode file names.
+ 
+These limitations will be fixed in future versions.
+
+
+Using 7z ANSI-C Decoder Test application:
+-----------------------------------------
+
+Usage: 7zDec <command> <archive_name>
+
+<Command>:
+  e: Extract files from archive
+  l: List contents of archive
+  t: Test integrity of archive
+
+Example: 
+
+  7zDec l archive.7z
+
+lists contents of archive.7z
+
+  7zDec e archive.7z
+
+extracts files from archive.7z to current folder.
+
+
+How to use .7z Decoder
+----------------------
+
+Memory allocation
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+7z Decoder uses two memory pools:
+1) Temporary pool
+2) Main pool
+Such scheme can allow you to avoid fragmentation of allocated blocks.
+
+
+Steps for using 7z decoder
+--------------------------
+
+Use code at 7zMain.c as example.
+
+1) Declare variables:
+  inStream                 /* implements ILookInStream interface */
+  CSzArEx db;              /* 7z archive database structure */
+  ISzAlloc allocImp;       /* memory functions for main pool */
+  ISzAlloc allocTempImp;   /* memory functions for temporary pool */
+
+2) call CrcGenerateTable(); function to initialize CRC structures.
+
+3) call SzArEx_Init(&db); function to initialize db structures.
+
+4) call SzArEx_Open(&db, inStream, &allocMain, &allocTemp) to open archive
+
+This function opens archive "inStream" and reads headers to "db".
+All items in "db" will be allocated with "allocMain" functions.
+SzArEx_Open function allocates and frees temporary structures by "allocTemp" functions.
+
+5) List items or Extract items
+
+  Listing code:
+  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+    Use SzArEx_GetFileNameUtf16 function. Look example code in C\Util\7z\7zMain.c file. 
+    
+
+  Extracting code:
+  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+  SZ_RESULT SzAr_Extract(
+    CArchiveDatabaseEx *db,
+    ILookInStream *inStream, 
+    UInt32 fileIndex,         /* index of file */
+    UInt32 *blockIndex,       /* index of solid block */
+    Byte **outBuffer,         /* pointer to pointer to output buffer (allocated with allocMain) */
+    size_t *outBufferSize,    /* buffer size for output buffer */
+    size_t *offset,           /* offset of stream for required file in *outBuffer */
+    size_t *outSizeProcessed, /* size of file in *outBuffer */
+    ISzAlloc *allocMain,
+    ISzAlloc *allocTemp);
+
+  If you need to decompress more than one file, you can send these values from previous call:
+    blockIndex, 
+    outBuffer, 
+    outBufferSize,
+  You can consider "outBuffer" as cache of solid block. If your archive is solid, 
+  it will increase decompression speed.
+
+  After decompressing you must free "outBuffer":
+  allocImp.Free(outBuffer);
+
+6) call SzArEx_Free(&db, allocImp.Free) to free allocated items in "db".
+
+
+
+
+Memory requirements for .7z decoding 
+------------------------------------
+
+Memory usage for Archive opening:
+  - Temporary pool:
+     - Memory for uncompressed .7z headers
+     - some other temporary blocks
+  - Main pool:
+     - Memory for database: 
+       Estimated size of one file structures in solid archive:
+         - Size (4 or 8 Bytes)
+         - CRC32 (4 bytes)
+         - LastWriteTime (8 bytes)
+         - Some file information (4 bytes)
+         - File Name (variable length) + pointer + allocation structures
+
+Memory usage for archive Decompressing:
+  - Temporary pool:
+     - Memory for LZMA decompressing structures
+  - Main pool:
+     - Memory for decompressed solid block
+     - Memory for temprorary buffers, if BCJ2 fileter is used. Usually these 
+       temprorary buffers can be about 15% of solid block size. 
+  
+
+7z Decoder doesn't allocate memory for compressed blocks. 
+Instead of this, you must allocate buffer with desired 
+size before calling 7z Decoder. Use 7zMain.c as example.
+
+
+Defines
+-------
+
+_SZ_ALLOC_DEBUG   - define it if you want to debug alloc/free operations to stderr.

+LZMA SDK 16.00
+--------------
+
+LZMA SDK provides the documentation, samples, header files,
+libraries, and tools you need to develop applications that 
+use 7z / LZMA / LZMA2 / XZ compression.
+
+LZMA is an improved version of famous LZ77 compression algorithm. 
+It was improved in way of maximum increasing of compression ratio,
+keeping high decompression speed and low memory requirements for 
+decompressing.
+
+LZMA2 is a LZMA based compression method. LZMA2 provides better 
+multithreading support for compression than LZMA and some other improvements.
+
+7z is a file format for data compression and file archiving.
+7z is a main file format for 7-Zip compression program (www.7-zip.org).
+7z format supports different compression methods: LZMA, LZMA2 and others.
+7z also supports AES-256 based encryption.
+
+XZ is a file format for data compression that uses LZMA2 compression.
+XZ format provides additional features: SHA/CRC check, filters for 
+improved compression ratio, splitting to blocks and streams,
+
+
+

+
+LZMA features
+-------------
+  - Variable dictionary size (up to 1 GB)
+  - Estimated compressing speed: about 2 MB/s on 2 GHz CPU
+  - Estimated decompressing speed: 
+      - 20-30 MB/s on modern 2 GHz cpu
+      - 1-2 MB/s on 200 MHz simple RISC cpu: (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC)
+  - Small memory requirements for decompressing (16 KB + DictionarySize)
+  - Small code size for decompressing: 5-8 KB
+
+LZMA decoder uses only integer operations and can be 
+implemented in any modern 32-bit CPU (or on 16-bit CPU with some conditions).
+
+Some critical operations that affect the speed of LZMA decompression:
+  1) 32*16 bit integer multiply
+  2) Mispredicted branches (penalty mostly depends from pipeline length)
+  3) 32-bit shift and arithmetic operations
+
+The speed of LZMA decompressing mostly depends from CPU speed.
+Memory speed has no big meaning. But if your CPU has small data cache, 
+overall weight of memory speed will slightly increase.
+
+
+How To Use
+----------
+
+Using LZMA encoder/decoder executable
+--------------------------------------
+
+Usage:  LZMA <e|d> inputFile outputFile [<switches>...]
+
+  e: encode file
+
+  d: decode file
+
+  b: Benchmark. There are two tests: compressing and decompressing 
+     with LZMA method. Benchmark shows rating in MIPS (million 
+     instructions per second). Rating value is calculated from 
+     measured speed and it is normalized with Intel's Core 2 results.
+     Also Benchmark checks possible hardware errors (RAM 
+     errors in most cases). Benchmark uses these settings:
+     (-a1, -d21, -fb32, -mfbt4). You can change only -d parameter. 
+     Also you can change the number of iterations. Example for 30 iterations:
+       LZMA b 30
+     Default number of iterations is 10.
+
+<Switches>
+  
+
+  -a{N}:  set compression mode 0 = fast, 1 = normal
+          default: 1 (normal)
+
+  d{N}:   Sets Dictionary size - [0, 30], default: 23 (8MB)
+          The maximum value for dictionary size is 1 GB = 2^30 bytes.
+          Dictionary size is calculated as DictionarySize = 2^N bytes. 
+          For decompressing file compressed by LZMA method with dictionary 
+          size D = 2^N you need about D bytes of memory (RAM).
+
+  -fb{N}: set number of fast bytes - [5, 273], default: 128
+          Usually big number gives a little bit better compression ratio 
+          and slower compression process.
+
+  -lc{N}: set number of literal context bits - [0, 8], default: 3
+          Sometimes lc=4 gives gain for big files.
+
+  -lp{N}: set number of literal pos bits - [0, 4], default: 0
+          lp switch is intended for periodical data when period is 
+          equal 2^N. For example, for 32-bit (4 bytes) 
+          periodical data you can use lp=2. Often it's better to set lc0, 
+          if you change lp switch.
+
+  -pb{N}: set number of pos bits - [0, 4], default: 2
+          pb switch is intended for periodical data 
+          when period is equal 2^N.
+
+  -mf{MF_ID}: set Match Finder. Default: bt4. 
+              Algorithms from hc* group doesn't provide good compression 
+              ratio, but they often works pretty fast in combination with 
+              fast mode (-a0).
+
+              Memory requirements depend from dictionary size 
+              (parameter "d" in table below). 
+
+               MF_ID     Memory                   Description
+
+                bt2    d *  9.5 + 4MB  Binary Tree with 2 bytes hashing.
+                bt3    d * 11.5 + 4MB  Binary Tree with 3 bytes hashing.
+                bt4    d * 11.5 + 4MB  Binary Tree with 4 bytes hashing.
+                hc4    d *  7.5 + 4MB  Hash Chain with 4 bytes hashing.
+
+  -eos:   write End Of Stream marker. By default LZMA doesn't write 
+          eos marker, since LZMA decoder knows uncompressed size 
+          stored in .lzma file header.
+
+  -si:    Read data from stdin (it will write End Of Stream marker).
+  -so:    Write data to stdout
+
+
+Examples:
+
+1) LZMA e file.bin file.lzma -d16 -lc0 
+
+compresses file.bin to file.lzma with 64 KB dictionary (2^16=64K)  
+and 0 literal context bits. -lc0 allows to reduce memory requirements 
+for decompression.
+
+
+2) LZMA e file.bin file.lzma -lc0 -lp2
+
+compresses file.bin to file.lzma with settings suitable 
+for 32-bit periodical data (for example, ARM or MIPS code).
+
+3) LZMA d file.lzma file.bin
+
+decompresses file.lzma to file.bin.
+
+
+Compression ratio hints
+-----------------------
+
+Recommendations
+---------------
+
+To increase the compression ratio for LZMA compressing it's desirable 
+to have aligned data (if it's possible) and also it's desirable to locate
+data in such order, where code is grouped in one place and data is 
+grouped in other place (it's better than such mixing: code, data, code,
+data, ...).
+
+
+Filters
+-------
+You can increase the compression ratio for some data types, using
+special filters before compressing. For example, it's possible to 
+increase the compression ratio on 5-10% for code for those CPU ISAs: 
+x86, IA-64, ARM, ARM-Thumb, PowerPC, SPARC.
+
+You can find C source code of such filters in C/Bra*.* files
+
+You can check the compression ratio gain of these filters with such 
+7-Zip commands (example for ARM code):
+No filter:
+  7z a a1.7z a.bin -m0=lzma
+
+With filter for little-endian ARM code:
+  7z a a2.7z a.bin -m0=arm -m1=lzma        
+
+It works in such manner:
+Compressing    = Filter_encoding + LZMA_encoding
+Decompressing  = LZMA_decoding + Filter_decoding
+
+Compressing and decompressing speed of such filters is very high,
+so it will not increase decompressing time too much.
+Moreover, it reduces decompression time for LZMA_decoding, 
+since compression ratio with filtering is higher.
+
+These filters convert CALL (calling procedure) instructions 
+from relative offsets to absolute addresses, so such data becomes more 
+compressible.
+
+For some ISAs (for example, for MIPS) it's impossible to get gain from such filter.

+
+I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over

+  OCB is covered by several patents but may be used freely by most

+  In particular license 1 is suitable for Libgcrypt: See
+  http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license1.pdf for the full
+  license document; it basically says:
+
+    License 1  License for Open-Source Software Implementations of OCB
+                (Jan 9, 2013)
+
+    Under this license, you are authorized to make, use, and
+    distribute open-source software implementations of OCB. This
+    license terminates for you if you sue someone over their
+    open-source software implementation of OCB claiming that you have
+    a patent covering their implementation.
+
+
+
+ License for Open Source Software Implementations of OCB
+ January 9, 2013
+
+ 1 Definitions
+
+ 1.1 Licensor means Phillip Rogaway.
+
+ 1.2 Licensed Patents means any patent that claims priority to United
+ States Patent Application No. 09/918,615 entitled Method and Apparatus
+ for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption, and any utility,
+ divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination,
+ reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the
+ aforesaid patent application. This includes, but is not limited to, United
+ States Patent No. 7,046,802; United States Patent No. 7,200,227; United
+ States Patent No. 7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675 ; and any
+ patent that issues out of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.
+
+ 1.3 Use means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.
+
+ 1.4 Software Implementation means any practice of any invention
+ claimed in the Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on
+ a user-programmable, general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a
+ computer-readable medium storing such software. Software Implementation does
+ not include, for example, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs),
+ field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.
+
+ 1.5 Open Source Software means software whose source code is published
+ and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the
+ source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify,
+ and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or
+ (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for
+ public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source
+ Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons
+ licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9,
+ 2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these
+ requirements for the purposes of this license.
+
+ 1.6 Open Source Software Implementation means a Software
+ Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is
+ Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include
+ any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed
+ Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is
+ not Open Source Software.
+
+ 2 License Grant
+
+ 2.1 License. Subject to your compliance with the term s of this license,
+ including the restriction set forth in Section 2.2, Licensor hereby
+ grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
+ non-sublicenseable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to practice
+ any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents in any Open Source Software
+ Implementation.
+
+ 2.2 Restriction. If you or your affiliates institute patent litigation
+ (including, but not limited to, a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
+ against any entity alleging that any Use authorized by this license
+ infringes another patent, then any rights granted to you under this license
+ automatically terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+ 3 Disclaimer
+ YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNLESS REQUIRED
+ BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
+ KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT EMBODYING ANY LICENSED
+ PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUT ORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
+ LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+ PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
+ CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
+ ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS, INCLUDING,
+ WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
+ OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
+ SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.

+libjpeg-turbo Licenses
+======================
+
+libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:
+
+- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
+  [README.ijg](README.ijg)
+
+  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
+  (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)
+
+- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed in
+  [turbojpeg.c](turbojpeg.c)
+
+  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs.
+
+- The zlib License, which is listed in [simd/jsimdext.inc](simd/jsimdext.inc)
+
+  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
+  SIMD extensions.
+
+
+Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
+=========================================
+
+This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
+best of our understanding.
+
+1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
+    then:
+
+    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
+        from the source.
+
+        **Origin**
+        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
+        - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
+        - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License
+
+    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
+        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
+        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
+        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)
+
+        **Origin**
+        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
+        - Clause 2 of the zlib License
+
+    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
+        copyright or license text in that file.
+
+        **Origin**
+        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
+
+2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
+    if you are distributing an application that statically links with
+    libjpeg-turbo, then:
+
+    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:
+
+        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
+        Group.
+
+        **Origin**
+        - Clause 2 of the IJG license
+
+    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
+        your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
+        License.
+
+        **Origin**
+        - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License
+
+3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
+    contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.
+
+    **Origin**
+    - IJG License
+    - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License
+
+4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
+    free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
+    consequences resulting from your use of the software.
+
+    **Origin**
+    - IJG License
+    - Modified BSD License
+    - zlib License

+
+EXPORT CONTROL:
+
+The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
+Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
+controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
+it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
+any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
+734.7(b).

+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
+Public License instead of this License.
